## Summary
What comes to your mind when you think about Chicago? Skyscraper? Jazz and blues music? The musical? These are all great representations of Chicago. Yet, Chicago has a strong culinary identity; it is renowned for having exceptional and diverse restaurants, even has a dish named after its city: Chicago-style pizza. While serving delicious food is crucial to becoming a city of appetite, sanitation around food places is as important. The City of Chicago's Department of Public Health conducts the city's food inspections to make sure food served on the table is not only delicious but safe. The sanitation of the whole city is in charge by the 311 non-emergency system, where they receive hundreds of reports weekly. 
Using the datasets publicly available from the two departments, we aim to explore on the correlation between the food inspection results and sanitation complaints across Chicago's neighborhood. This project will answer questions such as: Are Chicago neighborhoods with higher counts of 311 sanitation complaints also more likely to have restaurants that received a fail for city food inspections? Are neighborhoods with higher sanitary complaint volume also more likely to have higher inspection failure rates over the study period? Are there specific facilities that are more sensitive to external sanitation compared to others? Is there specific neighborhood(s) that appear to be more sensitive toexternal sanitation compared to others?

Unlike our hypothesis that food places that receive failure or conditional tend to have a higher rate of sanitation reports, our analysis did not find a significant correlation between food inspection results and 311 sanitation complaints across Chicago's neighborhoods. However, we did find that certain facility types, such as restaurants and schools, tend to have a slightly higher fail rate when there is an increase in sanitation complaints. This suggests that while there may not be a direct correlation across all neighborhoods, specific types of food establishments may be more sensitive to external sanitation conditions. Further research could explore the underlying factors contributing to this sensitivity and whether targeted interventions could improve food safety outcomes in these establishments.
