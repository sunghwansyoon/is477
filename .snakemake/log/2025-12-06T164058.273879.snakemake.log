MissingOutputException in rule hash_data in file "/Users/seanyoon/is477/Snakefile", line 15:
Job 1  completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
results/data_hash_manifest.csv (missing locally, parent dir contents: )
Shutting down, this might take some time.
