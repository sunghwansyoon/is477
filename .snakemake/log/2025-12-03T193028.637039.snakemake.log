Removing output files of failed job analyze since they might be corrupted:
results/zip_rank_by_sr_count.csv, results/zip_fail_vs_sr.csv, results/facility_type_summary.csv, results/plots/zip_rank_by_sr_count_top15.png, results/plots/fail_rate_vs_sr_count_scatter.png
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look below for error messages
