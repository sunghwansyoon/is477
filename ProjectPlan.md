### Datasets
#### Identify and describe the datasets that you will use. You need to use at least two different datasets that need to be integrated.
  * Food Inspections Dataset: https://data.cityofchicago.org/Health-Human-Services/Food-Inspections/4ijn-s7e5/about_data
    * This data is our primary data, where we expect to see the most observations. 
  * 311 Service Requests Dataset: https://data.cityofchicago.org/Service-Requests/311-Service-Requests/v6vf-nfxy/about_data
    * This data is our secondary data, which may help us to explain why certain inspections occur.

  Using the latitude and longitude information available in both datasets, we can track restaurants in Chicago that received food inspections from January 2019 to September 2025.
